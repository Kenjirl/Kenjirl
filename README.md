## 👋 Hi, I’m Kenjiro

Throughout my academic journey, I have explored into various aspects of programming, starting from fundamental logic and algorithms using C, basics of Android app development using Android Studio, and specializing in SQL for database management.

I have discovered my interest in **web development**, where I have gained a lot of experience using the Laravel framework for full-stack development. On the front-end side, I am practically good with HTML, CSS (particularly Tailwind), and JS (Jquery) for interface manipulation and responsiveness. Additionally, I have a decent understanding of the basics of ReactJS. I hope to create many interesting and useful websites for anyone.
